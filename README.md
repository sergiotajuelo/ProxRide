# ProxRide
ProxRide is a backend system for a ride-sharing platform designed to demonstrate clean software architecture, SOLID principles, and common design patterns. The project will evolve in multiple stages: starting with a minimal backend MVP and gradually extending to include persistence, APIs, notifications, distributed messaging, and cloud deployment.
